        <p>The primary purpose of an about us page is to
            inform the reader about the company and its
            operations. This is a straightforward goal that
            nearly all businesses have to fulfill in some
            fashion or another. However, there are other
            reasons why about us pages are common fixtures
        on business websites.</p>
